#### About me
My name is Muhammad Talha Jabbar and I am a graduate student of Computer Science at Texas Tech University. Pursuing a fulfilling career, I have found my true passion in computer science.

Throughout my academic journey, not only have I strengthened my commitment to this field, but I have also extended my knowledge in areas such as microservice architecture, multithreaded development, and software engineering. These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation to develop reusable software solutions and effectively solve complex problems.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained invaluable industry experience that has allowed me to improve my coding, debugging, and problem-solving skills. My exposure to critical problem-solving activities and testing applications has adequately prepared me to tackle real-world challenges effectively.

With my keen interest in data-intensive computing and distributed computing, I am constantly learning and implementing new techniques and algorithms to enhance performance and scalability effectively.

I am eagerly looking forward to contributing more to society by working on impactful projects.
